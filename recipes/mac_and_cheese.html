        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mac and cheese for one is quick and easy to prepare. 
            Once you try this homemade mac and cheese, you'll never want the boxed stuff again. 
            I cook mine in a soup crock.</p>

            <li>3 tablespoons uncooked macaroni pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>a tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch peper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground mustard</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. 
                Grease an oven-proof soup crock or 1-cup baking dish. </li>
            <li>Bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. 
                Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in the same pot over medium-high heat. 
                Whisk in milk, flour, salt, onion powder, and pepper until smooth.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir for 2 minutes. 
                Reduce the heat to low, then whisk in 1/3 cup Cheddar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. </li>
            <li>Stir in cooked macaroni until coated, then transfer to the prepared dish. 
                Sprinkle with bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon Cheddar. </li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until macaroni is heated through and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li><strong>Serve hot and enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
